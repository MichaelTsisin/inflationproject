<h2>
    How do Bonds work?
</h2>
</div>
<div class="symptom">
    <h3>
        Entry/Withdrawl
    </h3>
    <p>
        When you buy a bond, you are essentially buying a contract with the US governemnt where you pick between 10,5, and 2 years.
         You can pay any amount of money and it will be returned when the contract is over, with your additional % gain. If you close a bond before it Matures
         you will have to pay a fee, since you are technicaly voiding the contract.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="symptom">
    <h3>Current Returns </h3>
    <p>
        Currently Bonds are the #1 safest way to invest your money, because you are betting on the fact that the US government doesnt collapse.(near impossible)
    </p>
    <p>
        In the last two years government bonds have rebounded off of an all time low, meaning the going return rate is near 4% which was last seen 
        around 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although Bonds dont 100% beat current inflation(soon), they are the safest and easiest way to invest your money without having to worry about current economic stabiltiy, since your bond %return is fixed.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Bonds Directly Help America
    </h3>
    <p>
        Bonds are realased when the government needs funding, so by buying bonds you are directly contribituting to America's infrastructure and military.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gains on Bonds are also not taxed, which is an added benefit.
    </p>

</div>
<div class="symptom">
    <h3>My Opinon</h3>
    <p>
        Personally I wont be investing in bonds becase I am young and am interested in risking my money for exponential gains, but to the average American this is a good idea. Especially at these rates.
