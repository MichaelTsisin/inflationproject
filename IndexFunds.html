    <h3>Definition Of an Index Fund </h3>
    <p>
        The most popular index fund is the S&P500 which constists of the top 500 companies by market cap, that are traded on the New York 
        Stock Exchange, companies like Apple,Google, and Disney.It combines all of these 500 companies into one stock which moves up and down depending on the underlying companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thinking about it logistically if you hold S&P500 over a long time you will always be in profit as long as the top 500 companies are making money.The S&P500 does have risk.An example would be how in the last
         couple of months the market is down near 30%, which is a signifant amount, but for long term investors it's just a small spike.
