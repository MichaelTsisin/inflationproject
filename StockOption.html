            If you are on the riskier side and are intersted in picking your own indivudal stocks, this can be another investment strategy. If correct,the gains on an indivudal stock pick
            are much greater than the S&P500, but same with being wrong. Also, Options are an investment tool that lets you buy contracts that sort of leverage your money.

        <h3>Risk</h3>
        <p>
            Most people have no interest in picking indivudal stocks because they dont know anything about the stock market but, there are some that try.
            Both indivudal stocks and options are a big risk and should not be traded without prior investment knowledge.

        <p>
            I decided to trade only options after doing couple years of research and demo(fake money) trading. 95% of traders loss money but for now my portfolio has outdone the S&P500 by almost 600x.
            The problem with trading options is how they are difficult to trade and too volatile for most peoples interest in investing.
